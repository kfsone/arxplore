# Arxplore

Author: Oliver "kfsone" Smith <oliver@kfs.org>

Simple archive crawler.

Point arxplore at a directory structure, tell it how many workers to use, and
it will track down all the archives it knows how to deal with and list the
contents of all the files in them.


	arxplore /home/myname/files
	arxplore c:\windows
